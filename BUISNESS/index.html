<h1>Always be more creative than youre competitors</h1>

<p>Always being more creative than other competitors is an upper hand. This will grant you more customers and more customers means more money to what ever business that you are doing.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>

       <p> Ok lets see you have youre shop in a mall or in a place that have various different kind of shops around but youre shop is looking more beautiful or if you sell something completely different than the other shops that’s around you youre shop will look more highlighted than other shops that’s around you. So it means that you can get more customers and more money if you just <b>think outside the box</b>.</p>

<h1>Make it easy</h1>

<p>Always <b> making it easy for youre customers</b> is an huge upper hand because it will make these thoughts in youre customers head that going in and buying a thing is easy and because that’s is youre customers head they will think that it wont take that much time to buy whatever they buy.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>

      <p>All right lets see if youre in the food buisness. Its really great to have a drivethru because it will create this thing on the drivers head. That you dont have to get out of youre car and walk there so the human brain will sometimes force you to get some food because its easy.</p>

      <p>The other part is think that you own a supermarket if you only had one cashier it will take some time for youre customers to buy the items that theire looking for so the customers might think that this will take too long and they will exit so having more that one cashier is going to help so much.</p>

<h1>Always be next to youre competitors</h1>

<p>Ok this might seems dum but trust me this helps out a lot. Ok this is how this works if you had youre shop and <b>another shop right next to you. It might be better that you think</b>.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<p>Ok lets see if you own a coffe shop and another coffe shop is right next to you. You might not be thirsty but youre brain tricks you to buy a coffe because there are two brands of coffe rigt next to you so the customers will think which one to buy in that case youre customer might not even be thirsty.</p>
